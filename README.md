# Blockchain Voting Application - Prototype

## Overview
This project is a functional prototype of a secure, transparent electronic voting system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates the core mechanics of a decentralized application (dApp) for voting, including admin-based voter registration, on-chain vote casting, and real-time result tallying.

This simplified version serves as the foundation for a more advanced system. Future enhancements will include Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) to ensure complete voter anonymity.

## Features
- **Admin-Controlled Registration**: A contract owner can register eligible voter addresses.
- **On-Chain Voting**: Registered voters can cast a single vote for a candidate.
- **Transparent Results**: Vote counts are stored publicly on the blockchain and can be viewed by anyone in real-time.
- **Fraud Prevention**: The smart contract ensures that only registered addresses can vote, and each can only vote once.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) browser extension

### 1. Installation
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install backend dependencies:
    ```bash
    # In the project root directory
    npm install
    ```
3.  Install frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```

### 2. Run the Local Blockchain
In a new terminal, start the local Hardhat network. This will simulate the Ethereum blockchain on your machine.
```bash
npx hardhat node
```
Keep this terminal running. It will display a list of test accounts and their private keys.

### 3. Deploy the Smart Contract
In a second terminal, run the deployment script. This will compile the contract and deploy it to your local Hardhat network.
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### 4. Run the Frontend Application
In a third terminal, start the React development server.
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### 5. Configure MetaMask
1.  Open MetaMask and add a new network with the following details:
    - **Network Name**: `Hardhat`
    - **New RPC URL**: `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
    - **Chain ID**: `1337`
2.  Import the first two accounts from the `npx hardhat node` terminal output into MetaMask using their private keys.
    - **Account #0** will be the contract owner (Admin).
    - **Account #1** will be a voter.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integrate Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: To provide full voter anonymity.
- **Multi-factor Verification**: Combine with other ID checks for stronger eligibility assurance.
- **Mobile Integration**: Develop user-friendly mobile apps for broader accessibility.
- **Broader ZKP Support**: Incorporate more advanced ZKP schemes for enhanced security.

## Conclusion
This prototype successfully demonstrates a foundational blockchain voting system. It provides a clear and functional base for building a fully-featured, secure, and private e-voting platform.
